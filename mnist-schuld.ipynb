    "### State Preparation \n",
    "Before implementing the model circuit, Schuld et.al. conducts the state preparation. State preparation is the step in which we transfer the input vector into a n-qubit system of the quantum computer. Suppose that the input vector from the data is $R^{N}$. The mapping that takes this input into the quantum Hilbert space $C^{2n}$ is $\\phi$. Schuld et. al. suggests to take the input vector $x \\in R^{n}$ to be related to the amplitudes of the ket vectors in the $2^{n}$ dimensional Hilbert space (feature space). This is what is called **Amplitude Encoding**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Amplitude Encoding Requirement \n",
    "\n",
    "**If N is a power of 2**\n",
    "1. Make the input vector size $N$ to be a power of 2, which makes us able to utilize all the possible amplitudes created by the n-qubit system of the quantum computer.  \n",
    "2. input vector normalized to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "**If N is *not* a power of 2**\n",

    "This basically embeds the input vector $x$ into a higher dimensional space. Padding width in the above notation is $D$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the MNIST data implementation by Schuld et. al, the MNIST data set input vectors are coarsed grained to 256 dimensions. This corresponds to $2^8$ where 8 represents 8-qubits. Thus implementation #1 in the amplitude encoding requirement is taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the MNIST dataset, Schuld et. al. deskews the dataset and then coarse grains each of the examples to an image with dimensions (16,16), since when flattened out, the image becomes a 16x16 = 256 dimensional vector. Before, the amplitude encoding, we will first deskew and coarse grain the dataset below. "
